# 2D-Platformer-Character

3/27/23

This is the fourth project for my Game Technology Course. For this project I created a basic 2D Platformer game.

I decided to make a very chill platformer where the player can play as a penguin. 

## Implementation

Built using Godot 3.5

## References

I created the sprite sheets for my penguin character, the game background, and the icecube sprite using Procreate.

The music I used for the game is "Mall" which can be found on (https://patrickdearteaga.com/royalty-free-music/full-list/)

For the platforms I used the Platformer Art Pixel Redux pack from (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-pixel-redux)

For the icecube collecting sound effect I used sqeeeek_bell_ting2.wav by sqeeeek on (https://freesound.org/people/sqeeeek/sounds/237105/)

## Future Development

For future developments I would like to add some enemies and more levels.
